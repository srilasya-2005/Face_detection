# **Real-Time Facial Expression Detection using Mediapipe and OpenCV**

This project demonstrates a real-time facial expression recognition system using **Mediapipe FaceMesh** and **OpenCV**. It detects and categorizes facial expressions based on geometric relationships between facial landmarks and visualizes the results with a user-friendly interface.

---

## **Features**

- **Facial Landmark Detection**:  
  Identifies and tracks up to 468 facial landmarks in real time using Mediapipe's FaceMesh.

- **Expression Recognition**:  
  Classifies expressions into categories like:
  - **Neutral**
  - **Smiling**
  - **Surprised**
  - **Angry**

- **Visual Feedback**:  
  Displays live webcam feed alongside a plotted visualization of detected facial landmarks.

- **Real-Time Analysis**:  
  Processes video frames at runtime for immediate feedback on detected expressions.

---

## **Use Cases**

1. **Human-Computer Interaction**:  
   Emotion-aware systems for personalized user experiences.

2. **Retail and Marketing**:  
   Analyze customer reactions to products or advertisements.

3. **Healthcare and Therapy**:  
   Non-intrusive emotional state monitoring.

4. **Education**:  
   Evaluate student engagement during e-learning sessions.

## **Technologies Used**

- **OpenCV**:  
  For video capture and image display.

- **Mediapipe**:  
  Provides FaceMesh for facial landmark detection.

- **NumPy**:  
  Used for geometric calculations between landmark points.

## **How It Works**

1. **Capture Video**:  
   Uses OpenCV to stream live video from a webcam.

2. **Detect Landmarks**:  
   Mediapipe FaceMesh identifies facial landmarks in real time.

3. **Analyze Expressions**:  
   Calculates distances between key landmarks (e.g., eyes, lips) to determine expressions.

4. **Visualize Results**:  
   Displays the webcam feed and a blank canvas highlighting the detected landmarks.

## **Installation**

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/real-time-facial-expression-detection.git
   cd real-time-facial-expression-detection
   ```

2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
   ```

3. Run the program:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## **Future Improvements**

- Add more emotion categories like **sad**, **confused**, or **excited**.
- Incorporate machine learning models for improved accuracy.
- Store expression data for historical analysis.
- Enhance performance with GPU acceleration.
